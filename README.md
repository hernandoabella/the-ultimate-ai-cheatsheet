## AI Fundamentals
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science of building machines that can think, learn, and make decisions like humans. It powers everything from chatbots and virtual assistants to self-driving cars and medical diagnostics. By analyzing data, recognizing patterns, and automating tasks, AI enhances efficiency, improves decision-making, and drives innovation across industries.
### Types of AI:
- **Narrow AI (Weak AI):** Performs specific tasks (e.g., Google Search, Siri).
- **General AI (Strong AI):** Can understand, learn, and apply intelligence across various domains (not yet achieved).
- **Super AI** Hypothetical AI surpassing human intelligence.

### What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can mimic human intelligence by learning from data, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. It powers applications like chatbots, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars.

### Key AI Terminologies
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Machines simulating human intelligence.
- **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML using neural networks for complex tasks.
- **Machine Learning (ML)** AI that learns from data without explicit programming.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** AI trained on vast text data (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Gemini).
- **Supervised Learning:** AI learns from labeled data (e.g., spam detection).
- **Inference:** When an AI applies learned knowledge to new data.
- **Training Data:** The dataset AI learns from to make predictions.
- **Neural Networks:** Algorithms inspired by the human brain’s neuron connections.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** AI finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).
- **Reinforcement Learning** AI learns through rewards and penalties (e.g., game-playing AI).
